# AVL_Trees
# Introduction
Self-balancing binary search trees ensure efficient operations by maintaining a balanced structure. Two commonly used self-balancing trees are AVL Trees and Red-Black Trees. While both guarantee O(log n) operations, they have key differences in balancing strategies, performance, and use cases.

# 1. AVL Trees

# Overview:

An AVL Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the height difference between the left and right subtrees (balance factor) is at most ±1 for every node. It ensures a strictly balanced structure, leading to faster searches.

# Advantages:

✔ Faster Search (O(log n)) – The strict balancing ensures minimal tree height.

✔ Efficient for Read-Heavy Applications – Ideal when search operations dominate.

✔ Predictable Performance – Less variation in tree height ensures consistent performance.

# Disadvantages:

❌ Higher Maintenance Cost – Requires frequent rebalancing during insertions and deletions.

❌ More Rotations – Balancing after modifications leads to additional overhead.

# When to Use AVL Trees?

•	Databases and indexing – When fast lookups are needed.

•	Static datasets – Where insertions and deletions are infrequent.

•	 Applications with frequent searches – Such as caching systems.
